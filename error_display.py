    **The error you're seeing means your Azure OpenAI service has firewall rules blocking this connection.**
    
    ### Quick Fix Instructions:
    
    1. **Go to Azure Portal** (portal.azure.com)
    2. **Find your Azure OpenAI resource**
    3. **Click on "Networking" in the left sidebar**
    4. **Under "Firewalls and virtual networks":**
       - Currently set to: "Selected networks" 
       - **Change to: "All networks"** (easiest option)
       - OR add your current IP to the allowed list
    5. **Click "Save"**
    6. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for changes to take effect
    7. **Try uploading and analyzing a document again**
    
    ### Alternative Solution:
    If you need to keep network restrictions, you can add the current IP address to your allowed list in Azure.
    
    ### Security Note:
    "All networks" allows access from anywhere. If security is important, use IP restrictions instead.
